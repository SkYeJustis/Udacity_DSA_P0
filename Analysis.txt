# Task 0
The solution required O(1) time complexity because a known array index was being accessed.

The solution required O(1) space complexity because the only space taken is the input array itself and the
access operation does not require more space.


# Task 1
The solution required O(n) time complexity because the method used to obtain distinct numbers from the data set processed
each row of the input in the method: process_distinct_numbers. Increasing the items in the input list by n would
increase the number of steps by approximately n.

The solution can require up to O(n) because a distinct_number list is
the output and it is possible that the input can contain all distinct numbers.


# Task 2
The solution overall requires O(n log n) time complexity because the find_chattiest_phone_number method is used to find
number that has the longest total duration answering and making calls iterates trough each row, which is O(n),
and uses the python sorted() method to find the phone number with the longest total duration, which is O(n log n).

The space complexity of the solution can be O(n) because a dictionary recording the total duration of all the phone
numbers is kept and can be unique for each input row if all numbers are unique.


# Task 3
PART A:
The solution overall requires O(n log n) time complexity because the find_area_codes_and_mobile_prefixes method is used
to iterate through each row in the input and check specific conditions for each row, which is O(n) and the final
.sort() list method is used to ensure lexicographic order, which is O(n log n).
The solution overall can require O(n) space complexity if each processed row meets the condition and stores that data.

PART B:
The solution overall requires O(n) time complexity because the method perc_calls_fixed_to_fixed iterates through each
row of the calls data and checks for a condition.

The solution overall requires O(1) space complexity because constant variables is kept to allow for
a mathematical calculation.


# Task 4
The solution overall requires O(n log n) time complexity because the find_possible_telemarketers method is used to
iterate through each row in the calls data to obtain possible telemarketers, which is O(n) and the list .sort() method
is used to ensure lexicographic order, which is O (n log n).

The solution overall requires O(n) space complexity because the output list can contain all numbers from the call list.
